# Changelog

All notable changes to TokiRecur are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- **DeepSeek Harness now starts.** `dsh` was pinned in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`
  to a model id and a daemon port that no longer existed, so it failed with a
  bare `TRANSPORT: Connection error` and its TUI profile rendered nothing. The
  file was only ever written by `toki model use`, so switching the active
  model by any other path — or adding and removing models — left every
  config-owning client pointing at a dead endpoint.
- Client configs are now rewritten at launch time, not just on model switch.
  Launching is the last moment the answer is known and cannot go stale
  afterwards. A failed write warns and still launches rather than blocking.

### Removed
- **Meta Code, Cursor Agent and Devin are no longer offered in the launcher.**
  All three authenticate against their own account rather than a local stack,
  so none of them could use a model bound here. `protocol="account"` existed
  only for them and is gone with it; `openai` and `anthropic` remain.

## [0.2.33] - 2026-08-13

### Changed
- Hardware profiling drives backend detection and CPU tuning (`toki doctor`,
  `--profile`/`--no-profile`, 30-day profile TTL).
- Installers no longer download a model at install time; model selection is
  a separate, explicit step.
